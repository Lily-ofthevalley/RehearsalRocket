# RehearsalRocket

## Idea
A project in which someone can upload their theater script and the program analyses it and splits the roles and text and gives every role a voice. Then the user can choose one role to practice and the program reads out the other roles so the user can practice on their own.

## Plan
1. Make the concept in Python to see if its feasable.
2. Make a full version in C# to learn it and for better performance.
3. Make a mobile version of the program.
